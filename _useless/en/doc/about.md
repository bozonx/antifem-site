# About us

Anti-feminism is a movement for equality in society, which can only be achieved by addressing the source of gender inequality - feminism.

## Movement Goals

- To achieve true gender equality
- To tell the truth about feminism, which consists entirely of lies and manipulation.
- To tell men the truth about their true situation.
- To fight the negative impact of feminism on humanity, the drop in birth rates that feminism has led to, vaginocapitalism, matriarchy, and the enslavement of men to women
- To weed out social and political movements and platforms from feminism, especially left-wing political movements, which, as of 2024, are almost completely taken over by feminism
- To propose methodologies for fighting feminism and creating self-replicating resistance cells.
- Our ultimate goal is the total destruction and banning of feminism on a par with fascism.
- As a result, to make the world a better place and humanity happier and freer.
